# Link Check

Want to ensure that all the links in your git-based website are alive? This
project may help!

This script searches through the source file content of either a directory or a
git branch's difference from master. This means it's possible to both verify the life of 
every link in the repo and perform much smaller checks on branches to quickly ensure all 
new links are valid.
